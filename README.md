# Small Programming Projects

Welcome to my GitHub! Here, I share a collection of small programming projects that I've created to enhance my coding skills and deepen my understanding of various programming concepts. These projects serve as practical exercises that allow me to apply what I've learned and experiment with new ideas.

## About

As a passionate learner, I believe that hands-on experience is one of the best ways to grasp programming concepts. Each project in this repository represents a step in my journey as a programmer, showcasing my growth and understanding of different programming languages and paradigms.

## Projects

Here are some of the small projects included in this repository:

1. **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**
   - A simple console-based game where the player can play against the computer.
   - Implements basic game logic and random number generation.

Feel free to explore each project to see the code, understand the logic, and see how I approached each problem.

## Technologies Used
